//Primitive
//These are the built in datatypes
//they are divided into 7 categories
//string,number,bigint,boolean,null,undefined,symbol are all primitive datatypes

//Non-Primitives or Refernce
//These are datatypes created by user
//arrays,object,functions are non primitive datatype in javascript

//javascript is dynamically typed language because datatype will automatically assigned at the time of comiplation or code execution

//array
const arr = ["arsh" ,"punjabi", 'indian']
//return type of array is object

//object
const data = {
    name:"arsh",
    password:"124460"
}

//function
const func = function(){
    console.log("Arshpreet Kaur")//Function type
}
func()//Function call

//++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
//Memory - stack and heap
//stack - primitive - here we get a copy of a variable
//heap - non-primitive - here we get a reference means we get original value and changes to it means changing the real value
