//while
// while(condition){

let index=0;

}
//If condition remain same the loop will run infinite

//do while
// do{
//     statements;
//     incerment/decrement;
// }while(condition);

//The difference between while and do while is that in while loop condition is checked first and statements are executed later but in while loop statements are executed first and condition is checked later
//Also do while loop will execute for atleast one time even if the condition is false
